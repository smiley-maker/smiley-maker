# Hey! I'm Jordan,
[![Typing SVG](https://readme-typing-svg.demolab.com?font=Fira+Code&duration=3500&pause=1000&color=F74CED&width=435&lines=a+machine+learning+engineer;inspired+with+new+ideas)](https://git.io/typing-svg)

I'm graduating with my master's in engineering in March (2023) and am looking for a full time position in software engineering. 


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about natural language processing and ai for robotics

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a recipe recommendation system based on an image taken from a restaurant.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my approach to a new project idea (;

âš¡ Fun fact: I love [Eureka](https://www.amazon.com/Eureka/dp/B000U6BT40/ref=sr_1_1?crid=LDISLZ35BCSN&keywords=eureka&qid=1671690614&s=instant-video&sprefix=eureka%2Cinstant-video%2C177&sr=1-1) (a show about a genius small town that gets in tons of trouble)

I'm excited about a few projects I'm working on! Which one do you think I should start first?

- Book recommender based on readability and content
- Deep learning emotion recognition and playlist builder
- Recipe recommendations based on photo from restaurant
- Travelling Salesman Problem ... in Space!
